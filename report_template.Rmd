# General comments (you can delete this section)

_You can delete this section, and if you want to check what it said, just open a template from the package again. You don't have to use this particular template, but you DO need to write you report in RMarkdown and include a cover page._

_The cover page must have:_

*	_A title and subtitle_
* _"Report prepared for Black Saber Software by" your company name_
*	_Date (assessment submission date is fine)_

_You can change the colour of this cover to any colour you would like by replacing 6C3082 in the YAML above (line 11) to another hex code. You could use this tool to help you:_ https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/

# Executive summary

_Guidelines for the executive summary:_

* _No more than two pages_
* _Language is appropriate for a non-technical audience_
* _Bullet points are used where appropriate_
*	_A small number of key visualizations and/or tables are included_
*	_All three research questions are addressed_


\newpage
# Technical report
_This part of the report is much more comprehensive than the executive summary. The audience is statistics/data-minded people, but you should NOT include code or unformatted R output here._


## Introduction

_Provide a brief introduction to your report and outline what the report will cover. This section is valuable for setting scope and expectations. _

### Research questions
_Use bullet points to to describe the research questions you are going to address. Write in full sentences._

- Do males have a higher chance of being a successful candidate in each phase of the AI-directed selection than other genders do?

## Is gender a significant determinant of being a successful applicant in each hiring phase?

### Data Manipulation

### Exploratory plots/summary tables

```{r}
# add indicator variables of whether the applicant passed phase-I
success <- hire_phase2$applicant_id
hire_phase1 <- hire_phase1 %>% 
  mutate(pass = ifelse(applicant_id %in% success, 1, 0))

# add indicator variables of whether the applicant passed phase-II
success_2 <- hire_phase3$applicant_id
hire_phase2 <- hire_phase2 %>% 
  mutate(pass = ifelse(applicant_id %in% success_2, 1, 0))

# add indicator variable of whether the applicant passed phase-III
success_3 <- hire_final$applicant_id
hire_phase3 <- hire_phase3 %>% 
  mutate(pass_final = ifelse(applicant_id %in% success_3, 1, 0))
```

Table 1: Conditional probability table for the three phases of hiring

| Gender            | Phase I       |       | Phase II      |       | Phase III     |       |

  select(applicant_id, gender, total, pass_final)

colnames(hire_2_3) <- c("Applicant id", "Gender", "Total", "Pass")

knitr::kable(hire_2_3)
```


### Interpretation on summary tables before model fitting
#### Make any modifications if you want. btw originial version on google doc

Before we officially fit models, we build proportion tables to show the percentage of new graduates applicants who admitted to the next round. From table 1, conditional probability table for phase-I candidates, there is no obvious difference between the passing rate of males and females (males: 48.33%, females: 50.67%), therefore about half of the candidates go to the next round (phase-II). 

For table 2 and table 3, a significant difference of the passing rate is exhibited here. The passing rate for male applicants is more than twice that for female applicants; 68.18% males in the first round successfully go into the final interview, while there is only 31.81% females. The final round, which decides who gets the job, shows an even larger difference between the passing rate. Here, 80% of the males in the last get the job offer, where only 20% females get in eventually. Most of the female applicants stop in the second round.

At this time, it seems that men are more likely to be a potential candidates in Black Saber Consulting Company, but we still cannot make any inference or conclusion yet. After we fit models and assess relationships among different factors like GPA, work experience, and technical skills etc., we may make inferences at that time.

### Models

Table 3: Coefficient estimates for the logistic model built for hiring phase-I

```{r}
# filter out observations without cv or cover letter
hire_phase1_filtered <- hire_phase1 %>%
  filter(cv == 1) %>%
  filter(cover_letter == 1)

# build model
hire1_mod <- glm(pass ~ gpa + extracurriculars + work_experience, family = binomial(), data = hire_phase1_filtered)

# table for reporting
ests_h1 <- format(round(exp(summary(hire1_mod)$coef)[, 1], 2), nsmall = 2)
hire1_ci <- confint(hire1_mod)
cis_h1 <- round(exp(hire1_ci), 6)[-1,]
cis_h1 <- str_c("(", trimws(cis_h1[, 1]), ", ", cis_h1[, 2], ")")
pval_h1 <- round(summary(hire1_mod)$coefficients[, 4], 4)
hire1_rownames <- c("Baseline odds", "GPA", "Extracurriculars", "Work experience")

hire1_colnames <- c("Estimates", "95% CI", "P-value")

hire1_mod_table <- cbind(ests_h1, cis_h1, pval_h1)
rownames(hire1_mod_table) <- hire1_rownames
colnames(hire1_mod_table) <- hire1_colnames
knitr::kable(hire1_mod_table, align = c("r", "r"))
```

```{r}
# hire1_mod_wg <- glm(pass ~ gender + gpa + extracurriculars + work_experience, family = binomial(), data = hire_phase1_filtered)
# lmtest::lrtest(hire1_mod, hire1_mod_wg)
```


Table 4: Coefficient estimates for the logistic model built for hiring phase-II

```{r}
# build model
hire2_mod <- glm(pass~technical_skills + writing_skills + leadership_presence + speaking_skills, family = binomial(), data = hire_phase2)

hire2_ci <- confint(hire2_mod)

# table for reporting
ests_h2 <- format(round(exp(summary(hire2_mod)$coef)[, 1], 2), nsmall = 2)
cis_h2 <- round(exp(hire2_ci), 6)
cis_h2 <- str_c("(", trimws(cis_h2[, 1]), ", ", cis_h2[, 2], ")")
pval_h2 <- round(summary(hire2_mod)$coefficients[, 4], 4)
hire2_rownames <- c("Baseline odds", "Technical skills", "Writing skills", "Leadership_presence", "Speaking_skills")

hire2_colnames <- c("Estimates", "95% CI", "P-value")

hire2_mod_table <- cbind(ests_h2, cis_h2, pval_h2)
rownames(hire2_mod_table) <- hire2_rownames
colnames(hire2_mod_table) <- hire2_colnames
knitr::kable(hire2_mod_table, align = c("r", "r"))
```

```{r}
# hire2_mod_wg <- glm(pass~gender + technical_skills + writing_skills + leadership_presence + speaking_skills, family = binomial(), data = hire_phase2)
# 
# lmtest::lrtest(hire2_mod, hire2_mod_wg)
```


### Conclusions



## Informative title for section addressing a research question

_For each research question, you will want to briefly describe any data manipulation, show some exploratory plots/summary tables, report on any methods you use (i.e. models you fit) and the conclusions you draw from these_

```{r}
# This chunk provides an example of some things you can do with RMarkdown to make your report creation process easier

# read in the data
black_saber_current_employees <- read_csv("data/black-saber-current-employees.csv")

# create a visualisation
my_plot <- black_saber_current_employees %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = productivity)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "grey", fill = "#6C3082") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Look! A title. But do you want a title or a caption for your report?", x = "This is a changed x label")

# save your plot in your images folder, you can specify the height and width, too
# saving this means you can add the image to your exectuve summary without having to run or rerun the code, if you wish
ggsave("images/example.png", width = 7, height = 4)

# norice how the image is included with the ![](file/path.png) below
```

```

## Discussion

_In this section you will summarize your findings across all the research questions and discuss the strengths and limitations of your work. It doesn't have to be long, but keep in mind that often people will just skim the intro and the discussion of a document like this, so make sure it is useful as a semi-standalone section (doesn't have to be completely standalone like the executive summary)._

## Code of ethical conduct

_This section should be fairly short, no more than half a page. Assume a general audience, much like your executive summary._

* _Make at least three relevant statements about your company’s approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._
*	_Be very careful not to just copy and paste from these other documents! Put things in your own words._
